    <center><h2>Facts about a dog</h2></center>
    <p>Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world, and have lived with humans for
    more than 12,000 years.
    The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds.
    Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.
    Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
    military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.
    The “smell” center of a dog’s brain is 40 times larger than that of humans.
    Dogs dream like people.
    Dogs are as smart as a two-year-old child.
    Dogs only mate twice a year.
    Tail wagging has its own language.</p>
